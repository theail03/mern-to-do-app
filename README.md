## Notes

For Authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud, try writing the URL using http instead of https, in case https doesn't work.

The app uses cookies for authentication, so a custom domain with subdomains for both the API and the client is needed. Cookies from the application don't work in popular deployment sites like Render and Vercel.
